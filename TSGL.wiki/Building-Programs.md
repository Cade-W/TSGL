***NOTE:*** As of Summer 2016, there have been packages made for tsgl for ease of installation. Specifically, for Ubuntu and Red Hat (Fedora). As a result, if you install one of the TSGL packages, the generic ```Makefile``` will be located in ```/usr/include/TSGL_GENERIC_MAKEFILE/```. You can copy over the ```Makefile``` to your project directory and then follow the videos. 

Linux/Mac:

* Multi-file/class programs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nR9kCeEAR0

***NOTE:*** Type ```make clean``` after you have made a change to a ```.cpp``` or ```.h``` file. Then type ```make``` to remake the project (Linux/Mac only).

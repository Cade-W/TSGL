Found an issue with TSGL? Perhaps it's an annoying bug, or maybe it's a feature request. Maybe you have a question specific to one of the classes, or maybe you found a fix that another user might find particularly helpful. 

Or perhaps you'd like to leave a review of the library as a whole.

Whatever tickles your fancy, click the [Issues](https://github.com/Calvin-CS/TSGL/issues) tab (it looks like a circle with an exclamation point (!) ) and you'll be taken to the [Issues](https://github.com/Calvin-CS/TSGL/issues) page of the repository.

We will check it out or someone else will for you!

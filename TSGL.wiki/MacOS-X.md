As of Summer 2016, we now have a Mac OS X Installer which greatly simplifies the process of installing TSGL on a Mac. 

We wrapped it up in a ```.dmg``` file, which is located in the GitHub repo. 

You can download that file [here](https://github.com/Calvin-CS/TSGL/blob/master/MacBinInstaller/TSGL.dmg).

Once you have downloaded that file, follow these instructions:

1). Uncompress the file, then place the ```.dmg``` file anywhere that'd you like (e.g. ```~/Desktop/```).

2). Mount the ```.dmg``` file (double-click on it), and a new volume named ```TSGL``` should appear. 

3). Read the ```README.txt``` file. 

4). Open up the volume, and you should see a ```.pkg``` file named ```InstallTSGL```. Double-click on that file, follow the installation process, and TSGL should be installed on your Mac!

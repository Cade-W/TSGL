TSGL is a thread-safe graphics library useful for drawing graphics. You can do a wide variety of things with TSGL, including: image manipulation, 2D polygon drawing, text rendering, animations with keyboard and/or mouse events, and much more. All drawing and rendering is done with threads and in parallel. The main goal of this library is to provide a thread-safe graphics library for 2D graphics.

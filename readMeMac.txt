***NOTE***
If you do not have XCode installed, there may be a difference in the installation process. 
DO NOT CLICK INSTALL XCODE! 
Rather, click "Get XCode" and follow the on-screen instructions. 
That should be the only discrepency between the two installation processes. 
(XCode was already installed on the Mac in the video; that was why you did not see the window appear in it saying that XCode was needed).

Thank you for downloading TSGL for your Mac and enjoy!

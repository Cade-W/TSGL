      Click Configure
        Use "Visual Studio 10 2010" as the generator, using default native compilers
      Click Generate
    Open ALL_BUILD.vcxproj in VS 2010 and run "Build Solution" from the Solution Explorer

  Return to tsgl.vcxproj
    Right click on Project -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input
      Add the names of all of the libaries in your earlier lib directory under "Additional Dependencies"

        (NOTE: freeglutd.lib need not be listed here, but must be present in the includes/ directory)
    Right click on Project -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Debugging
      Under Environment, add "PATH=<path to your dll directory>;%PATH%"
    Copy your dlls from your earlier dlls directory into the project's Debug directory (for later)
    Right click on tsgl in the Solution Exploer, and click "Build"
    Run!

One-time setup for running tests:
  Click on the View Menu -> Property Manager
  In the Property Manager Pane, navigate to tsgl -> Debug |Win 32 -> testProperties
  Right click on testProperties -> Properties, and navigate to User Macros
  Verify that the TSGL directories are pointing to the appropriate directories, and, if not, change them accordingly:
    TsglDllDir should point to your earlier lib directory
    TsglExternalLibDir should also point to your earlier lib directory
    TsglIncludeDir should point to your earlier include directory

Creating a new project (for each test; e.g., testMandelbrot)
(NOTE: This should already be done for the bundled tests; these are intended to be directions for making your own)
  Make sure you've completed "Setup for running tests" above
  Right click on the tsgl Solution -> Add -> New Project
    Use an Empty Project, named after the relevant test (e.g., testMandelbrot), in the same directory as tsgl
  Right click on testMandelbrot -> Project Dependencies, and check "tsgl"
  Right click on testMandelbrot -> Add -> Existing Item
    Copy the relevant code from tsgl's src/tests folder into your new project's root directory
  On the Property Manager, right click on testMandelBrot -> Add Existing Property Sheet
    Navigate to tsgl's root folder and import testProperties.props
  Right click on testMandelbrot -> Build
  Run! (Right click on testMandelbrotin Solution Explorer -> Debug -> Start New Instance)

Notes:
  Polyline / Rectangle have naming conflicts with Windows classes; possible solutions:
    Rename the TSGL variants to something else (e.g., PolySegment and Quadrangle)
    Add a namespace around TSGL (might be the best, though it could take a while)
